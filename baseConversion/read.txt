There are several problems for which a stack is the perfect data structure needed for the
solution. In this section, we look at several such problems.
Base Conversions
A stack can be used to convert a number from one base to another base. Given a number,
n, which we want to convert to a base, b, here is the algorithm for performing the
conversion:
1. The rightmost digit of n is n % b. Push this digit onto the stack.
2. Replace n with n / b.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until n = 0 and there are no significant digits remaining.
4. Build the converted number string by popping the stack until the stack is empty.
