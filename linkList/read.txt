A linked list is a collection of objects called nodes. Each node is linked to a successor
node in the list using an object reference. 
The reference to another node is called a link.

             An Object-Based Linked List Design
Our design of a linked list will involve creating two classes. We’ll create a Node class for
adding nodes to a linked list, and we’ll create a LinkedList class, which will provide
functions for inserting nodes, removing nodes, displaying a list, and other housekeeping
functions.
