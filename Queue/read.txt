A queue is a type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the
front. Queues are used to store data in the order in which they occur, as opposed to a
stack, in which the last piece of data entered is the first element used for processing.

Queue Operations
The two primary operations involving queues are 
inserting a new element into a queue also called enqueue
             and 
removing an element from a queue also called dequeue
