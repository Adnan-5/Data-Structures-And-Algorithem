A dirctory is a data structure that store data as a key-value pairs, such as  
the way a phone book stores its data as name and phone numbers.
When you look for a phone
number, you first search for the name, and when you find the name, the phone number
is found right next to the name. The key is the element you use to perform a search, and
the value is the result of the search.
